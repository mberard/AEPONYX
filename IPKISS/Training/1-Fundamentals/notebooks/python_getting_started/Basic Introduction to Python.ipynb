In other words, if ``some_list`` were e.g. ``[0, 12, 4]``, the value of ``element`` would be 0 during the first iteration, 12 during the second and 4 during the last. In that case, the for-loop would be equivalent to:\n",

In other words: a class specifies a certain type of object which **has things and can do things**. We could for example define a class called Person. This class will specify the data, like the person's birthday, his/her name, the color of his/her hair, his/her length, a list of his/her friends and so on. This person class will also have a number of methods, like: walk, eat, sleep, go to the grocery store, ...

    "\n",
    "The second line of code defines a function called ``__init__``. This is the so-called constructor and will be called when an object of this class\n",

    "Inside the constructor method some ``attributes`` of the class are set on the ``self`` argument. This ensure we will be able to access these variables\n",

    "time-steps is created using the ``linspace`` function from numpy. This function generates an array of length ``no_o_samples`` ranging from ``0`` to ``length``.\n",

    "So now you will be able to create an object of the type `Signal` like this:\n",

    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no plotting tools built right into Python, but for scientific plotting we use a package called `matplotlib`. The usage of this\n",
    "module is very similar to plotting in MATLAB. To draw e.g. a 2D plot you write:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code:: python\n",
    "\n",
    "    plot(x_axis_values1, y_axis_values1)\n",
    "    plot(x_axis_values2, y_axis_values2)\n",
    "    xlabel(\"This text will appear under the x-axis\")\n",
    "    ylabel(\"This text will appear next to the y-axis\")\n",
    "    show()\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters in the ``plot()`` statements are arrays containing the x- and y- values. In this case 2 different graphs will be drawn on\n",
    "the same axes, because there are 2 plot statements. You can add axis labels using the ``xlabel()`` and ``ylabel()`` functions. The ``show()`` statement\n",
    "will actually draw the plot to the screen. Matplotlib has a very clear reference guide at :ref:`http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net`, where you will\n",
    "find a list of all the available functions and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement this feature into our ``Signal`` class. First, load the Matplotlib module by adding this line below the other two ``import`` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code:: python\n",
    "\n",
    "    import pylab as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath the ``get_fft()`` method definition, at the same indentation level, add the following code:\n",

    "        plt.xlabel('time (s)')\n",
    "        plt.ylabel('signal value (a.u.)')\n",
    "        plt.plot(self.time_steps, self.values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing new here. We don't include the ``show()`` statement yet because the user might want to combine different plots on the same graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "So we have built a signal class, we implemented methods to calculate the Fourier transform and plot the signal, and defined a sine signal class that\n",

    "    plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "First, our signals module and matplotlib are loaded. Our module is called ``signals`` because the file that contains the class definitions is called `signals.py`. (Make sure you\n",

    "Advanced class features\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned about object oriented programming and wrote a basic signal class. \n",
    "In this section we'll add some more advanced features to the class and learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Private methods\n",
    "* Method overloading    \n",

    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a class you might encounter situations where you want to write a helper method that you use a lot inside \n",
    "your class definition but that shouldn't be accessible for people that use the class. In this case you will want to use \n",
    "private methods, which are only accessible inside the class definition. You can indicate a method as private by adding \n",

    "            return\n",
    "            \n",
    "No time to waste, let's use it in our ``Signal``-class. We'll implement a more advanced plotting method that plots \n",
    "the signal and its Fourier image in 1 window on two different graphs. For that we'll define two private helper method, \n",
    "one that plots the signal itself and another one that plots the Fourier image.\n",

    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "The ``_plot_fft()`` method is nearly identical to ``_plot_values()``. The ``plot_signal()`` method starts \n",
    "by creating a new figure i.e. a new window. The second line is a mere technicality, telling \n",
    "matplotlib to increase the vertical space between two plots in a single window to 0.38 units. The third statement, \n",
    "``plt.subplot(2,1,1)`` indicates that we want the window to be divided into 2 (first argument) rows and 1 (second argument) \n",
    "column and that the next plot should be on the first (third argument) axes (which is the upper one). \n",
    "This is very similar to how you use subplots in MATLAB. Next, a title is set for that plot (passed as an optional argument) \n",

    "Operator overloading\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloading operators is something you won't be using a lot, but in this project it is very convenient and implementing it is a piece of cake. \n",
    "We want to be able to use the + (plus) operator between two objects of the signal class to generate a new signal who's value array is the sum \n",
    "of the value arrays of the two signals that were summed, the behavior you would expect from adding two signal objects together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within Python, you can define how operators like +, -, * and so forth should behave on a certain type. This is used within IPKISS to implement syntax like:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code:: python\n",
    "\n",
    "    s1 = i3.Shape([(0.0,0.0), (10.0,0.0)])\n",
    "    s2 = i3.Shape([(20.0,10.0), (30.0,30.0)])\n",
    "\n",
    "    s_full = s1 + s2\n",
    "\n",
    "So after reading this section you know how this works!\n",
    "\n",
    "To overload the plus (+) operator, you have to add the method ``__add__(self, signal)``, which returns ``self + signal``. The implementation of\n",
    "this method is straightforward: add the following code after the constructor (``__init__()``) in the Signal class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code:: python\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __add__(self, signal):\n",
    "        if (len(signal.values) != len(self.values)):\n",
    "            raise Exception(\"Error in Signal: __add__: length of 'signal.values' ({}) parameter differs from length of 'self.values' ({})\".format(len(signal.values), len(self.values)))\n",
    "\n",
    "        ret_sig = self.values + signal.values\n",
    "        return Signal(ret_sig, self.sample_rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "First we check if both signals have the same length, if they don't then we throw an exception. This means that the program will stop running \n",
    "and an error message will appear in the terminal. If the value-arrays have equal length, a new value array ``ret_sig`` is created that is the sum of the two value arrays. \n",
    "It is always good practice to include as much information in your error description as you can. The error message itself is formatted using the \n",
    "string formatting syntax that we used before. Finally a new signal object is instantiated using the new value array and the sample rate. \n",
    "It wouldn't be a bad idea to check if the sample rates are equal and raise an exception if they aren't - this is something you can try to implement yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test your overloaded operator by substituting ``sine = sig.SineSignal(length=2.0)`` in the main file with:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code:: python\n",
    "\n",
    "    sine = sig.SineSignal(length = 2.0) + sig.SineSignal(signal_frequency = 70.0, length = 2.0)\n",

    "Adding the Noisy Signal class\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the Noisy Signal subclass is similar to the Sine signal subclass, but instead of the sine function we use a random number generator that is \n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, the ``np.sin()`` function call is replaced by ``rnd.random()`` which generates an array of uniformly distributed random numbers. The ``random()`` function\n",
    "takes an argument which is the size of the array to be generated (in this case we tell it to generate a one-dimensional array of size ``self.time_steps``). It returns\n",
    "random values in the interval ``[0,1[``. We rescale it to have the correct amplitude and center it around 0.0 by subtracting 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a noisy signal to our sine signal and plot both. In `main.py`, add the following line after the sine signal is generated:\n",
